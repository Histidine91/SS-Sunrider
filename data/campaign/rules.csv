The most recent recordings show a Hegemony fleet being pursued by something in hyperspace. They had come to the star system to fight it alongside a Luddic Church fleet, but four Ryuvian Nightmares annihilated both in a matter of minutes.

The really alarming detail is an audio recording of radio chatter from what appears to be the Hegemony flagship. ""What the hell? The TPC is doing nothing! Are their shields immune to energy damage?""

The news leaves a sour taste in everyone's mouths. Should you encounter this fleet, it’ll be more than twice as difficult as the first time you fought Ryuvian monstruous technology.
